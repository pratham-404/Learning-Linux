    Learning Linux
</h1>


This repository is a collection of my learning journey through Operating Systems and Linux during my 4th semester of engineering. It includes various Linux commands, shell scripting files, and lab assignments conducted throughout the semester. I hope that it can serve as a useful resource for anyone who is also learning these topics.

If you have any feedback or suggestions, feel free to open an issue or pull request. For more detailed examples and explanations of Linux commands and shell scripting concepts, please refer to the individual files in the [Linux_Commands](https://github.com/pratham-404/Learning-Linux/tree/main/Linux_Commands) and [Shell_Scripting](https://github.com/pratham-404/Learning-Linux/tree/main/Shell_Scripting) directories, or to the lab assignments in the [Lab_Assignments](https://github.com/pratham-404/Learning-Linux/tree/main/Lab_Assignments) directory.

## Linux Commands

The [Linux_Commands](https://github.com/pratham-404/Learning-Linux/tree/main/Linux_Commands) directory contains a list of Linux commands that I learned during the semester. These commands are essential for navigating and manipulating the Linux operating system, and include commands such as `cd`, `ls`, `cp`, and `grep`. Each command is accompanied by a brief explanation of its usage.

## Shell Scripting

The [Shell_Scripting](https://github.com/pratham-404/Learning-Linux/tree/main/Shell_Scripting) directory contains various shell scripts that I created during the semester. Shell scripting is an essential skill for automating tasks and customizing the Linux environment. Some of the concepts covered in this section include variables, conditional statements, loops, functions, and input/output redirection.

## Lab Assignments

The [Lab_Assignments](https://github.com/pratham-404/Learning-Linux/tree/main/Lab_Assignments) directory contains the lab assignments that I completed during the semester. These assignments include tasks such as writing shell scripts to perform specific tasks, writing command-line programs, and configuring various aspects of the Linux operating system. Each assignment is accompanied by a brief description of the task and the expected output.
